/*
  Unique slugs for collections in Cockpit - https://github.com/agentejo/cockpit
  
  Place this code or copy this file in `/config/bootstrap.php`
  and adjust collection, field and slug name below.
  
  Notes:
  
  Your collection doesn't need a visible field named "slug", but you can't edit
  it if you don't have one.
  
  If you want to hide the slug field for non-admins, just add the folling code
  to the read permissions of your collection:
  
```
<?php
if ($context->user && $context->user['group'] != 'admin')
    $context->options['fields']['slug'] = false;
```
  
  The builtin option to sluggify fields via options `{"slug": true}` in the 
  backend uses Javascript and leads to different results ("Ã¤" becomes "a" 
  instead of "ae"). If you want unique slugs, that option is unnecessary.
